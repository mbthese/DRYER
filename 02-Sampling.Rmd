# Species

We selected 7 species, chosen according to their abundance in SFF and according to *in natura* availability during the wet season of 2021 (January-July 2021). To explore the variability of mechanistic traits linked to drought tolerance and root fungal community, we plan to measure *in natura* 10 seedlings per species known to be strictly affiliated to SFF or not.

  geom_hline(yintercept = 10, linetype = "dashed", col = "lightgrey")
