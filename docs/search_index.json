More frequent and intense drought events are being forecasted over the Amazon Basin, and few studies address how seasonally flooded forests will respond. We suggest a two-fold multidisciplinary approach which combines field measurements with a greenhouse experiment, exploring different drought scenarios in order to understand the resistance and resilience of species. All seedlings were sampled in seasonally flooded forests located at Paracou in French Guiana. The greenhouse experiment was designed using a randomized block design. We exposed seedlings to four different watering treatments, followed by a recovery period of one month. As mechanistic traits are closely linked to species physiological responses to abiotic environments, we will put into correlation the variation of seedlings mechanistic traits values with the microbiome. The community composition and diversity of leaf and root associated microbiota (bacteria + fungi) will be assess using high throughput sequencing methods. Ultimately, the goal is to determine if the microbiota associated with the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of tropical species are an additional means by which trees can improve their performance under future droughts. It will provide significant insights into the strategies of tropical species to cope with drought and improve our predictions of ecosystem functioning under future climatic regimes.

In roots, the beneficial effects of the microbiome, mycorrhizal fungi or Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, are known to promote nutrient and water uptake, stimulate germination, growth and plant fitness under abiotic stress. The challenge is now to analyze how tree-microbiome interactions will affect the resistance (ability to resist and maintain fitness) and the resilience (ability to recover) of plants in a changing environment.

The sampling area is characterized by a rugged landscape formed by the alternation of 4050 m high hills, slopes and bottomlands, varying in soil drainage type and water table depth (Gourlet-Fleury et al., 2004). Out of the three habitat types, species were only collected in the bottomlands. Bottomlands were described by Ferry et al 2010 with hydromorphic soils and a water table between 0 and 60 cm in depth depending on the season. We opted to sample 1 year-old seedlings as they are easy to access and represent a crucial stage in the establishment of a species. Indeed, the ability of seedlings to survive during drought has been shown to be a key determinant of species distributions for tropical forests (Kursar et al 2009), since the seed-to-seedling transition is where mortality from drought and resource limitation are critical.

Seedlings were then directly transplanted into 4 L pots filled with a sandy substrate composed of a 1:2 mixture of a brown ferralitic clay soil from terra firme forest. Seedlings were pooled in batch, organized by species and GPS position (1 GPS position equaled to 1 mothertree) (see Field Protocol for more details). Seedlings were grown in a shadehouse during at least one month and irrigated two times a day (8h and 18h during 5 mins). When the mortality rate was stable, seedlings were then placed into the greenhouse for the experiment according to a randomized block design. rotate.image(img, angle = 90, compress=NULL) The daily rainfall recorded by the Sinnamary Weather Station (MétéoFrance) over the past 64 years (1955-2019) enabled us to calculate the annual mean ± SD maximum number of consecutive days without rainfall (detection limit 0.2 mm) in a dry season (August-November): 21 ± 5 days. A decrease up to 30 % in precipitation trend is projected in the Amazon region by 2100 (3). The maximum number of consecutive days without rainfall was 71 days in 1976. We then ask ourselves could an extreme event of the past become more common in the future? Drought was induced by completely withholding water. We exposed seedlings to four different watering treatments, followed by a recovery period of one month (21). Well-watered every 2-3 days to field capacity (Control (C0)) Water withheld during 21 days (Current-DRY (D1)) Water withheld during 27 days, the projected norm 21 days + 30 % (Projected-DRY (D2)) Water withheld during 71 days, a rare event (X-DRY (D3)) Figure 6.2: Greenhouse design 6.5.1 Randomized design A randomized block design is an experimental design where the experimental units are in groups called blocks. The treatments are randomly allocated to the experimental units inside each block. When all treatments appear at least once in each block, we have a completely randomized block design. This kind of design is used to minimize the effects of systematic error. If the experimenter focuses exclusively on the differences between treatments, the effects due to variations between the different blocks should be eliminated. I used the blocksdesign package for the construction of block and treatment designs: blocksdesign::blocks(treatments=list(3,1,1),replicates=list(4,5,3),blocks = 4) 4 blocks containing: 3 different water treatments repeated 4 times 1 control treatment repeated 5 times (they are more individuals for the control group) 1 imaginary treatment repeated 3 times to have an even design The goodness or efficiency of an experimental design can be quantified: + D-effciency: a function of the geometric mean of the eigenvalues + A-efficiency : a function of the arithmetic mean of the eigenvalues Both are based on the idea of average variance, as the variance gets smaller, the efficiencies go lower. The best design is the one with the highest A- and D- efficiencies For the following block and treatment design, I obtained 0.9793704 and 0.9787234 for the A- and D- efficiencies respectively. Inside each treatment block, I organized the 7 species randomly. Again, 7 is an odd number, so I used an 8th imaginary species to obtain an even design. Example for the control group: blocksdesign::blocks(treatments=8,replicates=5,blocks = list(5,2)) Individuals for each species were then randomly assigned within each species block in order to mix mothertree origin within treatments.

Srinivasa Rao, K.S. Shivashankara, R.H. Laxman Section 1.3 : one of the earliest responses to soil flooding is a reduction in stomatal conductance, inhibition of stomatal aperture. Low O2 level may also reduce hydraulic conductivity and csqtly decrease root permeability. This descrease in hydraulic permeability may b liked to aqaporins [] limiting water uptake and this leading to internal water deficit. Oxygen deficiency generally induces a rapid reduction in the rate of photoS which is generally considered as the result of reduced stomatal aperture, decrease in leaf chloro content + early leaf senescence and a reduction in LA. Waterlogged soils reduce the translocation of photoS product from source to sink root. As a result, the maintenance of photoS acitivity and accumulation of soluble sugar in roots are clearly important adaptations to flooding. Plant responses to waterlogging include low stomatal conductance, decrease in leaf, root, and shoot devt, changes in osmotic potential and nu uptake, reduced chloro content and photoS. The oxygen diffusion is 10,000 times slower in waterlogged soils as compared to aerated soil. The decrease in O evel in soils affects the bioavailability of nu and as well as the ability of root systems to uptake and transport water + mineral nu. Waterlogging also causes inhibition of N-uptake from the soil and reducedleaf concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg in avocado + pea.
