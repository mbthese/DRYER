Shivashankara, R.H. Laxman Section 1.3 : one of the earliest responses to soil flooding is a reduction in stomatal conductance, inhibition of stomatal aperture. Low O2 level may also reduce hydraulic conductivity and csqtly decrease root permeability. This descrease in hydraulic permeability may b liked to aqaporins [] limiting water uptake and this leading to internal water deficit. Oxygen deficiency generally induces a rapid reduction in the rate of photoS which is generally considered as the result of reduced stomatal aperture, decrease in leaf chloro content + early leaf senescence and a reduction in LA. Waterlogged soils reduce the translocation of photoS product from source to sink root. As a result, the maintenance of photoS acitivity and accumulation of soluble sugar in roots are clearly important adaptations to flooding.
