More frequent and intense drought events are being forecasted over the Amazon Basin, and few studies address how seasonally flooded forests will respond. We suggest a two-fold multidisciplinary approach which combines field measurements with a greenhouse experiment, exploring different drought scenarios in order to understand the resistance and resilience of species. All seedlings were sampled in seasonally flooded forests located at Paracou in French Guiana. The greenhouse experiment was designed using a randomized block design. We exposed seedlings to four different watering treatments, followed by a recovery period of one month. As mechanistic traits are closely linked to species physiological responses to abiotic environments, we will put into correlation the variation of seedlings mechanistic traits values with the microbiome. The community composition and diversity of leaf and root associated microbiota (bacteria + fungi) will be assess using high throughput sequencing methods. Ultimately, the goal is to determine if the microbiota associated with the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of tropical species are an additional means by which trees can improve their performance under future droughts. It will provide significant insights into the strategies of tropical species to cope with drought and improve our predictions of ecosystem functioning under future climatic regimes.
